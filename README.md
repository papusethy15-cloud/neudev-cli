# ⚡ NeuDev — Advanced AI Coding Agent

NeuDev is a professional AI coding agent powered by **Ollama** and **Qwen 3.5**, featuring a rich interactive terminal interface inspired by RovoDev CLI.

## ✨ Features

- **ReAct Agent Loop** — Think → Plan → Act → Observe reasoning engine
- **9 Built-in Tools** — File read/write/edit/delete, search, grep, directory listing, command execution, code outline
- **Rich Terminal UI** — Syntax-highlighted output, spinners, color-coded messages, markdown rendering
- **Permission System** — Prompts before destructive operations (write, edit, delete, run command)
- **Session Tracking** — Full action history, file backups, undo support, session summary on exit
- **Model Switching** — Switch between any downloaded Ollama models with `/models`
- **Workspace Awareness** — Auto-detects project type, key files, and structure
- **Workspace-Safe Tools** — Relative paths resolve from the active workspace and stay inside it
- **Tool Fallback Parsing** — Converts text-based `<tool_call>` blocks into real tool executions for weaker models
- **Cross-Platform Prompts** — Adapts path guidance to Windows or Linux environments like Lightning Studio

## 📦 Installation

```bash
cd c:\WorkSpace\neu-dev
pip install -e .
```

This registers the `neu` command globally.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Start the interactive agent in the current directory
neu run

# Start in a specific workspace
neu run --workspace /path/to/project

# Use a specific model
neu run --model qwen2:1.5b

# Show version
neu --version
```
